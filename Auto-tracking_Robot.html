		<p class="projectintro">The entire robot comprises three components: a stationary transmitter used to transmit commands to the vehicle, a guide wire and a vehicle powered by batteries. The vehicle also works as a receiver which receives commands from the transmitter. The transmitter is controlled by an AVR-architecture based microcontroller, and the vehicle is controlled by an 8051-based microcontroller.</p>
		<p class="projectintro">The transmitter generates a square-wave voltage across the two ends of the guide wire, thus generating a time-varying magnetic field in nearby spaces. Thus voltages of different magnitudes are induced across the two inductors on the vehicle, telling the vehicle whether it has deviated from the track-wire or not.</p>

		</div>

		<p class="projectintro">I focused on designing the tank circuit which handles sinusoidal waves coming out from the inductors, and implementing algorithms using C to keep the vehicle on track and respond to commands sent to it.
