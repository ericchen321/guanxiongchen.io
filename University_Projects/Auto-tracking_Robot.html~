	<p class="ProjectsIntro">I built a robot like the picture on the left shows in a team of six people over the course of three weeks. How the robot works is illustrated in figures below:</p>

	<p class="ProjectsIntro">The entire robot comprises three components: a stationary transmitter used to transmit commands to the vehicle, a guide wire and a vehicle powered by batteries. The vehicle also works as a receiver which receives commands from the transmitter. The transmitter is controlled by an AVR-architecture based microcontroller, and the vehicle is controlled by an 8051-based microcontroller.</p>
	<p class="ProjectsIntro">The transmitter generates a square-wave voltage across the two ends of the guide wire, thus generating a time-varying magnetic field in nearby spaces. Thus voltages of different magnitudes are induced across the two inductors on the vehicle, telling the vehicle whether it has deviated from the track-wire or not.</p>
	<p class="ProjectsIntro">I focused on designing the tank circuit which handles sinusoidal waves coming out from the inductors, and implementing algorithms using C to keep the vehicle on track and respond to commands sent to it.
