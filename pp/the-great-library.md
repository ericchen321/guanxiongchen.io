# The Great Library

This is a simple and stupid **Java** program to manage books you have read or movies you have watched. Actually, why would I use the word "manage"... it doesn't manage anything, only keeps a list of these things with their basic info. [You can take a look at the project here](https://github.com/ericchen321/TheGreatLibrary).
