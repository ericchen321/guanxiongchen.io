		<h2 class="article_title">Electrical Engineering Program at the University of British Columbia (2015 - Present)</h2>
		<p>I'm currently working toward my Bachelor of Applied Science (BASc) degree. Over the course of the past few years I've taken courses about circuit analysis, computer organization, data structures and algorithms, and electromagnetism. More details regarding courses I've taken are below: </p>
		<div class="course_dropdown">
			<button class="course_button">ELEC 201, 202: Circuit Analysis</button>
			<div class="course_dropdown_content">
				<p class="course_grade">Grades: 93%, 90%.</p>
				<p class="course_intro">These two courses are for every Electrical Engineer: their syllabi comprises mesh analysis, nodal analysis, Thevenin and Norton equivalent, filters, Bode plot, and three-phase power.</p>
				<p class="course_skills">Notable skills: SPICE Tools</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="course_dropdown">
			<button class="course_button">CPEN 211: Introduction to Microcomputers</button>
			<div class="course_dropdown_content">
				<p class="course_grade">Grade: 78%.</p>
				<p  class="course_intro">This is a very enriched course. I learned digital logic, FPGA programming, topics on CPU architecture (pipelining, cache, etc,) and on operating system (virtual memeory, parallelism, etc.) A notable thing of this course is the 11 labs we had to do. Over the course of a month, we wrote a Turing-complete CPU almost from scratch. The labs took my partner and I a lot of time, and very often we were driven to the point of exhaustion. However thanks to the fact that both my partner and I are very competent, we completed most of the labs successfully.</p>
				<p class="course_skills">Notable skills: Verilog, ARM Assembly</p>
			</div>

		<div class="course_dropdown">
			<button class="course_button">CPSC 259: Data Structures and Algorithms</button>
			<div class="course_dropdown_content">
				<p class="course_grade">Grade: 92%.</p>
				<p class="course_intro">Stuff I learned from the course: pointers, binary tree, linked list, sorting algorithms.</p>
				<p class="course_skills">Notable skills: C</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="course_dropdown">
			<button class="course_button">ELEC 221: Signals and Systems</button>
			<div class="course_dropdown_content">
				<p class="course_grade">Grade: 93%.</p>
				<p class="course_intro">This course covers topics on the definition of systems and signals, state machines, stability, and Fourier Transforms. I also learned basics operations and script-writing using Matlab.</p>
				<p class="course_skills">Notable skills: Matlab</p>

		<h2 class="article_title">International Baccaleaurate Program at Beijing National Day School (2012-2015)</h2>
		<p>I completed IB with a final grade of 38/45. Here I'm listing a few notable courses I took. You may not be interested in these stuff if you want to hire me to do engineering work, but just so you know electrical engineering stuff is not everything I know.</p>
		<div class="course_dropdown">
			<button class="course_button">English A: Language and Literature (SL)</button>
			<div class="course_dropdown_content">
				<p class="course_grade">Grade: 5/7.</p>
				<p class="course_intro">I worked my butt off for this course. This is not an easy course, especially for a non-native speaker from China. I did Shakespeare, learned how to analyze various forms of text (advertisments, op-eds, newspaper articles, etc,) and I was trained to deliver my analysis to my audience in many different ways, like oral presentation or writing thousand-word-long essays.</p>
				<p class="course_skills">Notable skills: oral presentation, writing stuff</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="course_dropdown">
			<button class="course_button">Theory of Knowledge</button>
			<div class="course_dropdown_content">
				<p class="course_grade">Grade: B.</p>
				<p class="course_intro">This is a course about... well, everything. I mean it in the literal sense: you talk about everything from the universe to Aristotles to whatever is happening in your community. I like this course very much. It inspired me to learn some topics about American history and global affairs, which I would never know had I not take the course.</p>
