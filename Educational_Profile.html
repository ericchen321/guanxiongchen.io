		<h2 class="article_title">Electrical Engineering Program at the University of British Columbia (2015 - Present)</h2>
		<p class="institution_intro">I am currently working toward my Bachelor of Applied Science (B.A.Sc.) degree. Over the course of the past few years I have taken courses about circuit analysis, computer organization, data structures and algorithms, and electromagnetism. You can check out for more details regarding courses I have taken so far: </p>
		<div class="course_dropdown">
			<button class="course_button">ELEC 201, 202: Circuit Analysis</button>
			<div class="course_dropdown_content">
				<p class="course_grade">Grades: 93%, 90%.</p>
				<p class="course_intro">These two courses are for every Electrical Engineer: their syllabi comprise mesh analysis, nodal analysis, Thevenin equivalent and Norton equivalent, filters, Bode plot, and three-phase power. Besides these topics, I learned to program a HP-50g Calculator to streamline solving circuit problems.</p>
				<p class="course_skills">Notable skills: SPICE Tools, filter design</p>
			</div>

		<div class="course_dropdown">
			<button class="course_button">CPEN 211: Introduction to Microcomputers</button>
			<div class="course_dropdown_content">
				<p class="course_grade">Grade: 78%.</p>
				<p  class="course_intro">This is a very enriched course. I learned digital logic, FPGA programming, topics on CPU architecture (pipelining, cache, etc,) and on operating system (virtual memeory, parallelism, etc.) A notable thing of this course is the 11 labs I had to do. Over the course of a month, My partner and I wrote a Turing-complete CPU almost from scratch. The labs took my partner and I a lot of time, and very often we were driven to the point of exhaustion. However thanks to the fact that both my partner and I are very competent with Verilog and digital logic, we completed most of the labs successfully.</p>
				<p class="course_skills">Notable skills: Verilog, ARM Assembly</p>

		<div class="course_dropdown">
			<button class="course_button">CPSC 259: Data Structures and Algorithms</button>
			<div class="course_dropdown_content">
				<p class="course_grade">Grade: 92%.</p>
				<p class="course_intro">Stuff I learned from the course: pointers, binary tree, linked list, sorting algorithms.</p>
				<p class="course_skills">Notable skills: C</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="course_dropdown">
			<button class="course_button">ELEC 221: Signals and Systems</button>
			<div class="course_dropdown_content">
				<p class="course_grade">Grade: 93%.</p>
				<p class="course_intro">This course covers topics on the definition of systems and signals, state machines, stability, and Fourier Transforms. I also learned basics operations and script-writing using Matlab.</p>
				<p class="course_skills">Notable skills: Matlab</p>

		<h2 class="article_title">International Baccaleaurate Program at Beijing National Day School (2012-2015)</h2>
		<p class="institution_intro">I completed IB with a final grade of 38/45. Here I'm listing a few notable courses I took. You may not be interested in these stuff if you want to hire me to do engineering work, but just so you know electrical engineering stuff is not everything I know.</p>
		<div class="course_dropdown">
			<button class="course_button">English A: Language and Literature (SL)</button>
			<div class="course_dropdown_content">
				<p class="course_grade">Grade: 5/7.</p>
				<p class="course_intro">I worked my butt off for this course. This is not an easy course, especially for a non-native speaker from China. I did Shakespeare, learned how to analyze various forms of text (advertisments, op-eds, newspaper articles, etc) from different angles, like gender and race. Also I was trained to deliver my analysis to my audience using different methods, such as oral presentation or writing thousand-word-long essays.</p>
				<p class="course_skills">Notable skills: oral presentation, writing stuff</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="course_dropdown">
			<button class="course_button">Theory of Knowledge</button>
			<div class="course_dropdown_content">
				<p class="course_grade">Grade: B.</p>
				<p class="course_intro">This is a course about... well, everything. I mean it in the literal sense: I talked about everything from the universe to Aristotles to whatever was happening in my community. I like this course very much. It inspired me to learn some topics about American history and global affairs, which I would never know had I not take the course.</p>
