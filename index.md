# Bio

I am taking mostly computer-related courses, including: Software Construction (**Java**), Data Structures and Algorithms (**C and C++**), Microcomputers (**Assembly**), Digital Circuit Design (**Verilog**). 

Recently I am volunteering at the UBC SPIN (Sensory Perception & Interaction) Research Group. Under Dr. Kianzad's supervision, I am working on the project "Powerpen Localization with Embedded Camera & Watermarked Paper". We aim to develop a circuit and an algorithm running on Raspberry Pi to localize a device on top of a surface.

I am also familiar with some fields of Electrical Engineering, and have taken courses about control theory (**PID Control**), signals and systems, electric machines, and analog circuits design.
