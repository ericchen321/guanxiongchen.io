# Bio

A guy from 4-th Year CPEN at UBC. Aiming to get into a grad school and do some good research. Interested in **HCI**, **robotics**, **graphics** (particularly **physical simulation**).

Recently I am volunteering at the UBC SPIN (Sensory Perception & Interaction) Research Group. Under Dr. Soheil Kianzad's supervision, I am working on a project that aims to develop a haptic pen that allows people to sketch simple diagrams with geometric relationships (e.g. parallel, concentric, etc.) defined.

Also I am volunteering at the UBC VCR (Verification, Control & Robotics) Group, under the supervision of Prof. Ian Mitchell. I am working on a robotics-related project.
