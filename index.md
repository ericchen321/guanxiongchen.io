# Bio

I'm taking mostly computer-related courses, including: Software Construction (**Java**), Data Structures and Algorithms (**C and C++**), Microcomputers (**Assembly**), Digital Circuit Design (**Verilog**). 

I'm also familiar with some fields of Electrical Engineering, and have taken courses about control theory (**PID Control**), signals and systems, and analog circuits design.
